The Woozle does not appear in the chapter entitled In which Pooh and Piglet go hunting and nearly catch a Woozle, because it turns out that Pooh and Piglet have been tracking their own paw-prints round a tree, when they thought that they were tracking a Woozle, or two Woozles, or even a Wizzle, which is something else again.

If you look at the official Winnie the Pooh map you can see the marking "Where the Woozle wasn't".

Various Woozles also appear in Pooh's dream in the chapter In which Piglet is entirely surrounded by water.
